# HydraLiteBot Docs for Hydralite Maintainers

The maintainer's docs are currently a work in progress, but you can help Andrei Jiroh maintain these docs.

* [Bitwarden Vault Org](./bitwarden-org-vault.md)
* [Usage in GitHub Actions](./github-actions.md)
* [Automation with GitLab Ci/CD on GitLab SaaS mirror](./gitlab-cicd.md) - Currently <https://gitlab.com/hydralite/hydralite> is just an mirror to the canonical GitHub repo for now.
* [Doopler](./doopler.md) and [HashiCorp Vault](./hashicorp-vault.md) - secrets management stuff outside of the usual GitHub flow on storing secrets for GitHub Actions
